FragTV is an open source, cross-platform "GTV/SourceTV/etc" for QuakeLive, broadcasting live games and synchronizing with live video feeds.

FragTV works alongside standard gaming streams. It has its own browser to provide commentary, show the stream between matches and run ads.

During matches game data will be transmitted live to all clients and WolfcamQL will play it as a normal demo thats still being recorded. Audio from the stream provides synchronized commentary thanks to a small barcode and the twitch chat rooms are parsed and relayed to the ingame chat frame.
